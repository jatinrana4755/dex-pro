            <p>EXCHANGE is the first Ethereum based decentralized smart contract exchange to support real-time trading and high
              transaction throughput. EXCHANGE is the most advanced Ethereum DEX, supporting limit and market orders, gas-free
              cancels, and the ability to fill many trades at once.</p>

            <p>
              EXCHANGE consists of a smart contract, a trading engine, and a transaction processing arbiter. The smart contract is responsible
              for trustlessly storing all assets and executing trade settlement, and all trades must be authorized by the
              userâ€™s private keys.
            </p>

            <p class="top">
              However, unlike other decentralized exchanges, the EXCHANGE smart contract is designed such that only the exchange is authorized
              to submit signed trades to Ethereum. This enables EXCHANGE to control the order in which transactions are processed,
              separating the act of trading from final settlement. As users trade their exchange balances are updated in
              real-time, while simultaneously their private keys are used to authorize the trade in the contract. This authorization
              prevents users from rescinding any completed trades, and prevents EXCHANGE from initiating any unauthorized
              trades.
            </p>
            <p class="top">
              Authorized transactions are passed to the arbiter which manages the queue of pending transactions, dispatching them in sequence
              to ensure that each trade is mined in the correct order and that the smart contract balances stay in synch
              with the exchange balances. By controlling the transaction sequence, EXCHANGE provides the speed and user experience
              of centralized exchanges combined with the security and auditability of decentralized exchanges.
